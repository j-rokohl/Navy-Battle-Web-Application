                    <p class="mb-5"><strong>The Navy Battle Web Application provides a desktop interface to play the classic board game 
                    “Battleship”. This web app is for in person play or play on Zoom and does not include an option to play 
                    the computer. Each user can use their own computer to play. This is a great game to play offline with a 
                    friend or family member, while on an airplane or without internet access.</strong></p>

                    <h2 class="instruction">Playing this Game</h2>

                    <h3 class="rules">Place your ships on the grid</h3>
                    <p>To place your ships on the board, click either the "Horizontal" button or the "Vertical"
                    button. You will notice that your cursor changes into the ship icon. Hover over the "Your Ships" 
                    grid to see available spots. Click the spot to place the ship. To undo the ship placement, click
                    the undo button beside the "Vertical" button.</p>
    
                    <h3 class="rules">Press the start button</h3>
                    <p>After you place all five ships on the grid, click the "Press to Start" button at the top left. 
                    Now, you can click the grid to mark hits and misses on your grid. You can also erase or 
                    undo by clicking a square a second time. You'll also notice that the left column now has
                    ships listed, where you can mark them as "Sunk".</p>
    
                    <h3 class="rules">Taking turns</h3>
                    <p>After you have pressed the "Press to Start" button, players take turns guessing by
                    calling out the coordinates. The opponent responds with &quot;hit&quot; or &quot;miss&quot; 
                    as appropriate.&nbsp; Both players should mark their boards by clicking their grids.</p>
                    
                    <h3 class="rules">Marking your grid (left side)</h3>
                    <p>When all of the squares that one of your ships occupies have been hit, the ship
                    will be sunk. You should announce &quot;hit and sunk,&quot; mark your grid and mark 
                    your ship as "Sunk" on the left hand side.</p>
    
                    <h3 class="rules">Marking your opponent's grid (right side)</h3>
                    <p>To record your guesses to hit your oponent's ships, click a box once to record a miss, click 
                    twice to record a hit, and click a third time to erase an error. You can mark your opponent's 
                    ship as "Sunk" on the right hand column.
                    </p>
    
                    <h3 class="rules">Finishing the Game</h3>
                    <p class="mb-5">As soon as all of one player's ships have been sunk, the game ends.</p>

                    <h2 class="instruction">Classic Rules for BattleShip</h2>

                    <h3 class="rules">Game Objective</h3>
                    <p>The object of Battleship is to try and sink all of the other player's ships before
                    they sink all of your ships. All of the other player's ships are somewhere on
                    his/her board.&nbsp; You try to hit them by calling out the coordinates of one
                    of the squares on the board.&nbsp; The other player also tries to hit your ships
                    by calling out coordinates.&nbsp; Neither you nor the other player can see the
                    other's board so you must try to guess where they are.&nbsp;
                    Each player has two grids:&nbsp; the left section for the
                    player's ships and the right section for recording the
                    player's guesses on Opponent Ships.</p>

                    <h3 class="rules">Game Rules</h3>
                    <p>Each player places the 5 ships somewhere on their board.&nbsp; The ships can
                    only be placed vertically or horizontally. Diagonal placement is not allowed. No
                    part of a ship may hang off the edge of the board.&nbsp; Ships may not overlap
                    each other.&nbsp; No ships may be placed on another ship.&nbsp; </p>
                    <p>Once the guessing begins, the players may not move the ships.</p>
                    <p>The 5 ships are:&nbsp; Aircraft Carrier (occupies 6 spaces), Battleship (5), Cruiser
                    (3), Submarine (3), and Destroyer (2).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
